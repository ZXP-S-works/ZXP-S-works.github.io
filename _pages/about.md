## Research Interests
I am working on robotics and machine learning. My research interests line on 
leveraging robot manipulation by reinforcement learning, and streamlining robotic systems to fulfill real-world
applications. Currently, I am working on equivariant neural networks and model based reinforcement learning.

## Education
I am a Ph.D. student in the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu)
at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu). I am working in
[The Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/), advised by Professor
[Robert Platt](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/rplatt/).
